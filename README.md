Air Quality Forecasting Dashboard

# Project Overview  
This project aimed to forecast air pollution levels (PM2.5, PM10, AQI) for major cities in New Zealand using machine learning and time-series models. Results were visualized via an interactive dashboard built with Flask and React (locally deployed for demo).

# Context  
Developed during a Data Science internship at the University of Auckland.  
Our team worked with over 100,000 rows of traffic, weather, and pollution data to build interpretable and accurate forecasting models.

# Technologies & Tools  
- Languages & Libraries: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- Models Used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, LSTM, CNN  
- Data Processing: SQL, pandas  
- Visualization: Power BI (EDA), Flask + React (dashboard)  
- Version Control: GitHub

# Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Integration**  
   - Merged datasets from multiple sources  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies using SQL and pandas  
   - Improved model input quality and consistency

2. **Modeling & Evaluation**  
   - Trained and compared multiple models: RF, GBM, SVM, LSTM, CNN  
   - Evaluated using R² and MSE (e.g., PM2.5 model achieved R² ≈ 0.30, MSE ≈ 2.38)  
   - Final selection based on accuracy and interpretability

3. **Deployment & Communication**  
   - Supported dashboard creation using Flask + React (locally hosted for internal demo)  
   - Results presented via slide deck and stakeholder feedback sessions

# My Contributions  
- Led model training and evaluation efforts  
- Cleaned and transformed data using pandas and SQL  
- Experimented with neural networks (LSTM/CNN) to capture temporal patterns  
- Collaborated with teammates to integrate model outputs into a working dashboard
